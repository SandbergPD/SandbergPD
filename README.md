- 👋 Hi, I’m @SandbergPD
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, data analytics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can get me real world experience, and get me into the job market quickest
- 📫 How to reach me SandbergPD@gmail.com is easiest, but I currently revamping my linkedin, so hopefully there soon!

  I am a blue collar worker, having experience in culinary and being an electrician, but have recently found a passion for IT. 
  Given the fact that the future for tech is ever growing, I see now is the perfect time to learn and grow.
